## Problem Description

Find the union of two non-decreasing linked lists. For example, merging the lists 1->2->3 and 2->3->5 results in 1->2->3->5. The result should be output without modifying the data in the two linked lists.

## Input Format

The first line contains the values of the nodes in the first linked list, separated by spaces.
The second line contains the values of the nodes in the second linked list, separated by spaces.

## Output Format

The merged linked list in non-decreasing order, with values separated by spaces.

## Example Input

```
4 7 10 34
1 4 6 29 34 34 52
```

## Example Output

```
1 4 6 7 10 29 34 52
```

## Grading Criteria

* The implementation must use linked lists; otherwise, no points will be awarded.
