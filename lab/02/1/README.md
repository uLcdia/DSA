## Task Description

The task is to write a program that determines whether a given string is a "palindrome". A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.

## Input Format

The input consists of a single line containing a string. The length of the string is guaranteed to be less than 100 characters.

```
input_string
```

## Output Format

The output should be a single line containing either "yes" if the input string is a palindrome, or "no" if it is not.

```
yes or no
```

## Example 1

**Input:**

```
abcdcba
```

**Output:**

```
yes
```

**Explanation:**
The string "abcdcba" reads the same forwards and backwards, so it is a palindrome.

## Example 2

**Input:**

```
abcdfsfdsg
```

**Output:**

```
no
```

**Explanation:**
The string "abcdfsfdsg" does not read the same forwards and backwards, so it is not a palindrome.

## Grading Criteria

*   Correctly reads the input string.
*   Correctly determines if the string is a palindrome.
*   Outputs "yes" for palindromes and "no" otherwise.
